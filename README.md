# Hey You üï¥Ô∏è

I‚Äôm Arjan, a software engineer/architect happily working at [Xebia](https://xebia.com).

I‚Äôm an **Open Source** adept. I've been using and writing open source software ever since I started programming, more than 25 years ago. I favor working on a **Linux**-based machine, running [GNOME Desktop](https://gnome.org).

For the last few years I've been writing mostly **Python**. I also like to write **Elixir**, a bit of **Typescript**, and the occasional shell script.

### My (Open Source) Work

Lately I‚Äôve been actively working on:

- **[Pytest-archon](https://github.com/jwbargsten/pytest-archon)**: a little tool my colleage [Joachim](https://github.com/jwbargsten) and me built to enforce rules on your Python application architecture.
- **[Gaphor](https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor)**: a modeling tool for SysML/UML models. It‚Äôs a lot of fun building a desktop app in my spare time, while building webapps for work.
- **[PyGObject](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/pygobject)**: a Python library that provides language bindings for the GNOME ecosystem (e.g. [GTK](https://gtk.org/)).

I've been maintainer of **[FitNesse](https://github.com/fitnesse)** for a couple of years.
