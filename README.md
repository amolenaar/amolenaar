## Hi, You ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Arjan, a software engineer/architect happily working at [Xebia](https://xebia.com).

Iâ€™m an Open Source adept. I've been using and writing open source software ever since I started programming, more than 25 years ago. I favor working on a Linux-based machine, running [GNOME Desktop](https://gnome.org).

For the last few years I've been writing mostly Python.

### My (Open Source) Work

Lately Iâ€™ve been actively working on:

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://github.com/jwbargsten/pytest-archon">pytest-archon</a></dt><dd>A little tool my colleage @jwbargsten and me build to enforce rules on your Python application architecture.</dd>
  <dt><a href="https://github.com/gaphor/gaphor">Gaphor</a></dt><dd>A system modeling tool based on SysML/UML.</dd>
</dl>

I've been maintaining [FitNesse](https://github.com/fitnesse) before that for a couple of years.
